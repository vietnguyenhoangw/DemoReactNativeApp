### What I have leant from this project :chart_with_upwards_trend:

- Construced project (Folder, flow...) following [Ignite-cli](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite)
- Working with data, request (end-point, api, json...)
- Redux, javascript handle...
and more...

### >>> still update for demo in app, and more features...
